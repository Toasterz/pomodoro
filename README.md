#Pomodoro timer
I am building a pomodoro timer web app using:
  - HTML
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery
  - NodeJS for serving the application

###User Stories:
  1. As a user, when I navigate to the page, I see a timer at 0 mins.
  2. As a user, when I navigate to the page I want to see a start button that starts the timer counting up.
  3. As a user, when I click the start button, the timer counts up to 25 mins.
  4. As a user, when the timer hits 25 minutes I want to hear a bing and see a pop up.
  5. As a user, when I click out of the pop up I want a 5 min timer to start counting down automatically.
  6. As a user, when the 5 min timer hits 0 mins I want to hear a bing and see a pop up.
  7. As a user, when I click the start button I want to be able to repeat the process.
