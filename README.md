#Pomodoro timer
I am building a pomodoro timer web app using:
  - HTML
  - Bootstrap
  - JQuery
  - NodeJS for serving the application

###User Stories:
  1. As a user, when I navigate to the page, I see a timer at 0 mins.
  2. As a user, when I navigate to the page I want to see a start button that starts the timer counting up.
  3. As a user, I see a 'break' button that is disabled.
  4. As a user, at 25 mins, the break button enables.
  5. As a user, when I click the start button, the timer counts up to 25 mins.
  6. As a user, I see a 'tooltip' for the break button.
  7. As a user, when the break button is enabled I can click it.
  8. As a user, when I click the break button the timer sets to 5 minutes and begins counting down.
